    "the sun rises slowly over the hills as morning light stretches across the valley birds begin to sing while dew sparkles on every leaf the quiet breeze moves through the trees creating a soft rustle that adds to the calm of the early hour a fox peers from its den sniffing the fresh air and taking careful steps into the open field rabbits hop near the bushes alert but calm squirrels chase one another around the tall oaks while a stream flows gently over smooth stones nature awakens with grace and purpose each creature playing its part in the rhythm of the day as the sun climbs higher the colors of the world brighten shadows shrink and warmth spreads across the land flowers open to greet the light and bees begin their busy dance above them everything feels alive connected part of something bigger there is no rush only the steady pulse of life in balance the stillness of the forest holds a quiet wisdom that speaks without words teaching the value of patience and peace the path ahead winds gently through the trees inviting wanderers to walk slowly and notice the details beneath their feet the sound of leaves crunching underfoot the distant call of an owl the flutter of wings in the underbrush these are the moments that remind us to slow down to breathe and to listen the world has much to offer when we take the time to see it not with haste or worry but with calm eyes and an open heart and in this space even the smallest things like the flicker of sunlight on water or the soft curve of a petal can fill us with joy and wonder";

export const punctuationText = `The early morning light painted the sky with hues of orange, pink, and soft gold. Birds began to sing, one after another, creating a melody that gently welcomed the new day. Trees swayed in the calm breeze, their leaves rustling like whispers in a quiet room. Somewhere nearby, a fox emerged from its den, blinking at the sunlight and stepping forward with care.

A stream ran beside the trail, bubbling over smooth stones. Its steady rhythm blended with the sounds of nature, offering peace to anyone who paused to listen. A deer stood in the distance, still and observant, before bounding away into the woods. Flowers opened in slow motion as bees hovered and buzzed, beginning their tireless work.

People began to stir. Windows opened. Coffee brewed. The smell of breakfast drifted down the lanes of a quiet village waking from sleep. Children laced their shoes, ready for school. Adults packed lunches, read the news, and prepared for the day ahead.

Despite the growing movement, there was a calm—a sense that everything was unfolding as it should. A man sat on a bench near the park, notebook in hand. He wrote slowly, watching the world without urgency. Across from him, a young girl walked her dog, laughing as it tugged at the leash.

These were simple moments, yet full of meaning. They reminded us that the most beautiful parts of life are often the quietest. The rustle of leaves, the laughter of a child, the warmth of sunlight through a window—all small, perfect pieces of a larger story.

And so, the day moved forward—not with a rush or a roar, but with gentle persistence, like the turning of the earth itself. A new chapter began, written in the language of life.`;

export const paragraphText = `On April 1st, 2025, at exactly 6:15 a.m., the town of Elmsworth began to wake up. The sun, rising slowly, cast golden light across rooftops and trees. By 6:30 a.m., birds could be heard singing—twelve of them perched across five trees. The temperature was 18°C, perfect for an early jog or a quiet walk through the park.

At 6:45 a.m., Mr. Collins left his house for his usual 3.2-mile walk. Every fifteen minutes, he paused to stretch or check his step count. He passed two playgrounds, one library, and four bakeries. At 7:30 a.m., a bus marked “Route 22” picked up seven children heading to school. It stopped three more times before arriving at 7:50 a.m.

Meanwhile, the local bakery had already sold 60 of its 100 fresh loaves. The goal was to sell 120 by noon. Around 8:00 a.m., a woman bought three muffins and two croissants, enjoying her breakfast with a cup of coffee and a crossword puzzle.

By 8:30 a.m., 52 cars had passed down Main Street. Traffic remained light, with a speed limit of 30 km/h strictly followed. A sign reminded drivers: “Safety First – School Zone Ahead.”

At 9:00 a.m., two joggers stretched near the park fountain, while six ducks paddled calmly around a floating branch. A father and daughter counted them out loud, laughing as the ducks formed a perfect line.

As the clock struck 10:00 a.m., the town had settled into its daily rhythm—work, school, errands, and a few stolen moments of peace. Though the numbers varied, the pattern remained: time moved forward, tasks were completed, and small joys made the difference.

And with every tick of the clock, a new moment was written—simple, counted, cherished.`;
